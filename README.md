## What is an epic story?
- An agile epic is a workload that can be broken down into smaller tasks called stories. They are broken down based on the specific needs of the customer or user.
- They often encompass multiple teams working on multiple projects.
- They are delivered over a set of sprints.

## What is a user story?
- A user story is a generalised explanation of a product feature written from the perspective of the end users.
- It is meant to explain how a specific feature provides the end users with value.
- An example of a user story exemplar is:
    - "As a \<person>, I want \<some goal> so that \<reason>"

## Examples
- One of the benefits of this way is that epics and user stories can be written at differing levels of detail, allowing flexibility in development.

**Example 1**
- Epic story:  
As a user, I can backup my hard drive

This can be split up into specific user stories, depending on which type of user we are interested in helping currently.

- User story 1:  
As a power user, I can specify files or folders to backup based on file size, date created and date modified.

- User story 2:  
As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.
