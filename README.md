# Epic and user stories

**What is an epic story?**
- An agile epic is a workload that can be broken down into smaller tasks called stories. They are broken down based on the specific needs of the customer or user.
- They often encompass multiple teams working on multiple projects.
- They are delivered over a set of sprints.
- Could include some time-scale for completion
- Use cases are the high level business goals that the end users wish to achieve by using the product.

**What is a user story?**
- A user story is a generalised explanation of a product feature written from the perspective of the end users.
- It is meant to explain how a specific feature provides the end users with value.
- The user story should allow people to choose specific features and requirements to be implemented.
- Each user story contributes to the completion of the epic story.
- D.O.D. is usually when the stated user can complete the outlined task.

**Benefits**
- One of the benefits of this way is that epics and user stories can be written at differing levels of detail, allowing flexibility in development.
- Epics allow teams to always have a connection to a greater business goal in mind.
- User stories allow teams to keep their focus on the end user while enabling collaboration.

**Example**
- Epic story:  Improve streaming service for Q1 launch
    - This can be split up into specific user stories, depending on which type of user we are interested in helping currently.

- User story 1:  
iPhone users need access to a vertical view of the live feed when using the mobile app.

- User story 2:  
Android users need to be linked to apple store.

- User story 3:  
Desktop users need a “view fullscreen” button in the lower right hand corner of the video player.

- **In this example, the epic would have to be completed by possibly 3 separate teams:**
    1. An android team
    2. An iOS team
    3. A desktop team

**How do epic and user stories fit in with Agile and Scrum?**
- Initially, epic stories are written by product managers or product owners etc. and set to be reviewed.
- After, user stories can be created based on the different users they are considering and added to the product backlog.
- In the planning phase of a sprint or iteration, the team can choose which user stories they'll deal with during that sprint or iteration.
- The user stories will be on a sprint backlog and over the course of the sprint, each one is taken care of.
- After each sprint, more and more user stories will have been dealt with.

**Summary**
- Epics usually have time-boxed requirements and therefore fit well in Agile as a goal to accomplish over a certain number of sprints/iterations.
- User stories fit in perfectly with Scrum: each sprint requires a team to accomplish a certain amount of work and user stories can be used to choose the features and requirements that the team should finish.
